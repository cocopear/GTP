# GTP

A Tiktok Hackathon 2023 project by Coco Li, Fong Kai Jun, Lai Hsuan Jung, Jairus Ho, and Gopal Radhakrishnan Ramanen Bharatwa.

### Chosen Problem Statement
Problem Statement - 1: Optimize Advertisement Moderation

Problem Statement:
• Theme: social media advertisement moderation process optimisation:
Create a stochastic optimization model to (a) dynamically score and prioritize social media advertisement for review and (b) match content to be reviewed with the best fitting moderator.


### About the Project
Our project aims to optimize the pairing of moderators and advertisements to minimize negative impact and maximize positive impact on Tiktok. We have normalized variables in the advertisers data set to create a weighted composite priority score for the advertisers. In the moderator’s data set, we normalized variables to create a weighted composite capability score for the moderators. Using these two composite scores, we devised a more optimal matching between the advertisers and moderators. 

Details about our project can be found in [this file](https://github.com/cocopear/GTP/blob/main/tiktok%20p1.ipynb), where we conducted exploratory analysis on the data given, computed composite scores, and matched moderators to advertisers.
