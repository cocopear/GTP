### About the Project
Our project aims to optimize the pairing of moderators and advertisements to minimize negative impact and maximize positive impact on Tiktok. We have normalized variables in the advertisers data set to create a weighted composite priority score for the advertisers. In the moderator’s data set, we normalized variables to create a weighted composite capability score for the moderators. Using these two composite scores, we devised a more optimal matching between the advertisers and moderators. 

Development tools used to build the project:
Jupyter Notebook, Github, Visual Studio Code

APIs used in the project:
Pandas, Scipy, Gurobi

Assets used in the project:

Libraries used in the project:
sklearn, python matching

Details about our project can be found in [this file](https://github.com/cocopear/GTP/blob/main/tiktok%20p1.ipynb), where we conducted exploratory analysis on the data given, computed composite scores, and matched moderators to advertisers.
